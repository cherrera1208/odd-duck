# odd-duck

This is the R&D department's research page for an odd little company that makes odd little products called ducks

## The process

"subjects" will be shown a slideshow of multiple "ducks" to choose from. The *subject* will simply click on their preferred image of *ducks* and at the end, a graph will show them their results. What will odd-ducks LLC do with this data? Who knows.

## The How

This page is possible by implementing a few clever coding techniques. First, the constructor function that builds all of the ducks displayed from an array images of products in testing. Second, the user can interact with the site with the help of event functions, which "listen" to and "handle" certain page event, in this case, clicks. Next, the user's preferences are shown on a bar graph with the help of a package called chart.js. Finally, the data is stored in a stringified JSON file in local storage to be recalled later.
